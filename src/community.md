### Issue Tracking & Bugs

We use GitHub to track project bugs, enhancement requests and to do feature planning.

The [Kuadrant project](https://github.com/Kuadrant/) is made up of a range of components, each with their own issue trackers. You can find all of these by navigating to a specific component, and looking at its respective `Issues`.

### Getting Involved

We welcome new contributors to the project, be you a seasoned multi-cluster networking expert, or someone new who is looking to improve some wonky documentation you come across. Many of our respositories include variants of a `good-first-issue` label for issues that might be good to start with. 

#### Thinking about some initial contributions? 

Consider fixing some bugs, trying Kuadrant and telling us about your experience or helping us hone our documentation.
