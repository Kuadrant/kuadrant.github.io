{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-ban" title="Limitador" url="https://github.com/Kuadrant/limitador" %}}
Limitador is a generic rate-limiter written in Rust. It can be used as a library, or as a service. The service exposes HTTP endpoints to apply and observe limits. Limitador can be used with Envoy because it also exposes a grpc service, on a different port, that implements the Envoy Rate Limit protocol (v3).
